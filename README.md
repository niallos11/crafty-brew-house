# CraftyBrewHouse
Code Institute - Project1

The CraftyBrewHouse is a meetup group for Craft Beer & Homebrew enthusiasts throughout all of Ireland.
The club is all about teaching and learning about craft beers & homebrewing.
The idea is the social club offers a great way to meetup fellow Brewers to share ideas and taste some of the best craft beers available in Ireland.

## Features 

The center of pages has the meetup group logo and below this has the name of the company / club.
Below this is the three navigation links: Home,Beer,Join Us.
The navigation uses a font that is clean & minimal looking with a color that contracts the background.
The navigation is clean and makes it easy for a user to go to different sections of the site.

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 


- __The landing page image__

The landing page features a large image with freshly brewed craft beers from the club. 
This is to show the range of craft beers you can learn to brew by joining the club.
